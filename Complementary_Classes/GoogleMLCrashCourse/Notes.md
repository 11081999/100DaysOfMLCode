##  Framing

This module investigates how to frame a task as a machine learning problem, and covers many of the basic vocabulary terms shared across a wide range of machine learning (ML) methods.

**(SUPERVISED) Machine Learning** : Supervised learning uses a training set to teach models to yield the desired output. This training dataset includes inputs and correct outputs, which allow the model to learn over time. The algorithm measures its accuracy through the loss function, adjusting until the error has been sufficiently minimized.

Supervised learning can be separated into two types of problems when data miningâ€”classification and regression.
